\section{Conclusion}

We proposed an improved version of DeFMO that uses GANs to overcome its problems with biased losses.
We also proposed a novel loss function to capture smooth movement across sub-frames.
This method can also generalize better to other related applications, like temporal super-resolution, due to more general loss functions.
Experimental results show that the proposed model performs better than DeFMO (re-implemented) on their benchmark, but at the cost of higher memory usage during training.
We also implement popular memory optimization techniques and refactor the codebase to make is easier to use, maintain, and extend the approach.
For future work, one can train a larger version of the model (using ResNet-50) on full resolution images with sufficient compute to possibly beat the original DeFMO and achieve state-of-the-art results.
