\section{Conclusion}

We proposed an improved version of DeFMO that uses GANs to overcome its problems with biased losses.
We also proposed a novel loss function to capture smooth movement across sub-frames.
This method can also generalize better to other related applications, like temporal super-resolution, due to more general loss functions.
% TODO: Explain that this is referring to the re-implementation of DeFMO
Experimental results show that the proposed model performs better than DeFMO on their benchmark, but at the cost of higher memory usage during training.
We also implement popular memory optimization techniques and refactor the codebase to make is easier to use, maintain, and extend the approach.
% TODO: Explain that achieving SoTA is due to beating original DeFMO, not re-implemented DeFMO
For future work, one can train the model on full resolution images with sufficient compute to possibly achieve state-of-the-art results.
