DeFMO is an algorithm that aims to remove motion blur in images using a neural network to deblur individual frames as well as generate `sub-frames', as if captured by a high-speed camera (i.e.\ temporal super-resolution).
% TODO: Say what GANs are
This project extends DeFMO using GANs.
Our approach overcomes limitations within the loss formulation of DeFMO, more accurately captures the `quality' of the generated outputs, and thus improves results.
We also introduce a novel loss function for tackling temporal consistency among generated sub-frames.
Further, we optimize the codebase to be more memory-efficient, and improve readability and maintainability.
